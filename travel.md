#### Travel

Portland is serviced by Portland International Airport (PDX). Transportation options from the airport include the [TriMet MAX light rail service](https://trimet.org/max/index.htm), which connects PDX to the city center in ~40 minutes via the Red Line ($2.80 fare), and taxis or ride-share services like Lyft and Uber. The drive between the airport to downtown takes approximately 15 minutes, though traffic can double this time.

Accessibility to the OSU Portland Center building via public transportation is convenient and highly encouraged. There are several MAX stops within a one block radius. Additional bus lines are also located in close proximity.
